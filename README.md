# Context

Your are given an existing React-Redux codebase and your challenge will be to refactor the App.jsx file and add a new feature with tests.

# Task & Objectives

[] Please refactor the App.jsx file so that there is a <ContactList/> component and <ListItem/> component in separate files which are then imported into the App.jsx file. The Greeting component is a good example of this.

[] Right now you can add and delete a contact but the contact does not have a phone number associated with it. Please add a phone number input so that each contact that is created will have a corresponding phone number. Here is the documentation for more information on the telephone input element https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel

[] Please write a test for your new feature. One DOM test should use the fireEvent function. There should be at least one unit test.
